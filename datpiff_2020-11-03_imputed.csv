But the Baton Rouge MC is feeling empowered across Still Flexin, Still Steppin, a mixtape that arrives just four months after AI YoungBoy 2, the first No. 1 album of his career. Throughout Still Flexin there are continuous references to murder, drugs, diamonds, and women, YoungBoy livingâ€”in rhymeâ€”the way only a 20-year-old rap superhero might. He lowers his weapons momentarily on â€œRed Eyeâ€ and â€œNo Understand,â€ singing to prospective life partners, but even these softer-edged selections can have mixed messaging, YoungBoy reminding said partner on â€œRed Eyeâ€ what makes him: ""Who you judging, I come up straight from the gutta/Real struggle, me and my brothers had no one but each other.â€",no,,,284974,1084,4,2/21/2020,yes,"Still Flexin, Still Steppin",14,362352

BobbyJRockaway,Bobby J From Rockaway,sponsored,no,"ï¿½Summer Classicsï¿½ is the debut album from Queens, NYC native Bobby J From Rockaway. Boasting production from Hip-Hop veterans like Kwame, Statik Selektah, Sway in the Morningï¿½s DJ Wonder, and Jake One and features from lyrical heavyweights like Lilï¿½ Fame and Killah Priest, the album is not only an homage to his hometown of Rockaway Beach but also classic Hip-Hop. 

The title is inspired by the ï¿½Summer Classicï¿½ basketball league that has been a staple of his community for generations. In his own words Bobby states: ï¿½I feel like every rapper wants that one song that dominates the summertime. My goal was to make a project full of those kinds of records. Something you can play from top to bottom while driving with the top down - Summer Classics.ï¿½

Available now on all streaming platforms.

teegrizzley,Tee Grizzley,none,yes,"Blue-collar isnï¿½t the first term most would use to describe a rapper whose 2016 debut single, ï¿½First Day Out,ï¿½ includes a story about visiting a Rolex storeï¿½to rob it, to be clear. But Tee Grizzley is a true workhorse in the image of his Motor City roots. In an age of increasingly blurred lines between rap and R&B, the Detroit MC is determined to let complex, verbose bar-spitting get him where he needs to be, rather than leaning on melody and vibe. Still My Moment builds on the groundwork Grizzley laid with 2018ï¿½s Activated and the original My Moment from 2017. On the new album, the rapper diversifies his collaborative guild, tapping Chance the Rapper, Lil Pump, and rising Florida rapper YNW Melly to buttress intricate tales of Detroit street life. Thereï¿½s plenty of message to be had here as well, with Grizzley using songs such as ï¿½Wake Upï¿½ and ï¿½Babies to Menï¿½ to assure people who look up to him that they, too, can have what he hasï¿½if theyï¿½re willing to work hard enough.",no,,,189631,919,4,11/9/2018,yes,Still My Moment,15,267972

The first track on the project, ""Murder Was The Case,"" appears to be recorded by Drakeo over a phone, which may have spit during his currnet time behind bars. While the entire project was posted to the rising star's Soundcloud page, it sounds as though only the first and last record, ""Cyber Bullies"" feature the ""Flu Flamming"" entertainer. The rest of the EP is handled by other members of the Stinc Team including SaysoTheMac, Ketchy The Great, Ralfy The Plug and Bambino.
The new project also contains features from the Young Bull, ALLBLACK and Bino Rideaux, as well as productions from YFK98, Al B Smoov, Navin, Low The Great and more.

It's going to be a long legal road for Drakeo after the rapper was arrested and charged him with first-degree murder, attempted murder and several counts of conspiracy to commit murder back in March.

WheresHeres,TiDUS,exclusive,no,"I've grown a whole lot since ""Soon You'll Understand"". Learned even more about my outlook on life, life itself and how to flow within it. I remembered my powers, I remembered how to see it in others. I remembered my higher self. Along with that I also remember the darkness, can't forget that cause not too long ago I was struggling to find a way out of it, but its too late now. Much too late now, cause I am of the light, and I decided nothing can change that. I'm here for you and nothing can change that. The vibes are here for us and nothing can change that, only YOU. Feel me?
With that said I want to THANK YOU ALL for being a part of this journey and continuing to vibe with me as we create the future. ""Before It's Too Late"" is the final verse of this chapter, I hope this helps you as much as it's helped me. Love & See you soon.

karlkani,Hamburger Helper,sponsored,no,"Lefty, the Hamburger Helper mascot, dropped a mixtape today and the Internet lost its mind.

Titled Watch The Stove, the project initially looked like another goofy marketing ploy from a corporation looking to cash in on hip-hop culture. Then everyone pressed play and realized, â€œwhoa, this thing is actually really good.â€ Within hours, it was a trending topic on Twitter.

We had to find out who was behind the music on this thing.

After some digging, we learned that General Mills reached out to music manager/educator Craig Rice for help putting the project together. Rice, a teacher at McNally Smith College of Music in Minnesota, then linked GM up with Toki Wright. An established hip-hop artist having released albums with Rhymesayers, Wright is also the Department Head of the nationâ€™s first fully accredited Hip-hop Studies Diploma and Minor Program at the school.

Jumping at the chance to get his students involved in a project that could reach a large audience, they got to work. After spending months developing concepts and ideas, they pitched them to GM and recorded the mixtape. They also connected with Minneapolis College of Art and Design to produce videos for two of the songs.

Coming from all over, the students involved were GeNreal (New Hampshire), illWIN (Ohio), Dan D (North Carolina), and Theory (Indiana).

Band member Josh Epstein explains the inspiration behind Produce: ""Before Nate Dogg passed away, I was listening to some of his old songs and thinking bout how incredible it is that he was able to sing such absurd lyrics and yet, always sound so cool. I started writing an album for his voice. He passed away a month later, and I was instantly filled with regret. Not because I believed that we would make that album together, but because I wished I'd been able hear more of his voice.  That became the inspiration to start the same project on a smaller scale:  One song for one of our favorite artists, whose voice we wanted to hear more of.  

The song ""Rush Into Love"" was written specifically for Slim from 112.  It was written for his voice. While we were finishing ""The Speed Of Things,"" our mastering engineer--Colin Leonard--read an interview in which we had named Slim a dream collaborator.  He was working on Slim's new record and played him our music.  We sent Slim the track and he sent it back a day later with that silky smooth vocal. Later, we asked Chuck Inglish--whom we also admire greatly--if he wanted to do a verse and sent the track to him, and the whole song just felt right. We're grateful for having had the opportunity to work with such incredible artists, and are excited to share this mixtape.""",yes,6553,,7387,15,4,2/5/2014,yes,Produce Vol. 1,16,86478

I appreciate you giving me the time I needed to grow, experiment, and find the direction for my 2nd album.. And I have.
Along the way Iâ€™ve recorded at least 4 albums worth of material, lots of it being unfinished demo versions waiting to be polished up, some of them are great songs and important stories that just wonâ€™t make the album (either they donâ€™t fit Sonically, donâ€™t fit Theme, or thereâ€™s just not enough space) .

Tonight, I want to give you a few of these songs because you deserve them. Itâ€™s hard as fuck for me to keep all this music from you for so long, so I know itâ€™s been hard for you to wait. Thank you for your patience. Vibe out to these songs in their raw form, no polish.. just a lot of my soul..

Listening to their sage lyrics, itâ€™s hard to believe theyâ€™re only 21 (Ak) and 22 (Issa Dash) years old. And on the strength of â€˜Indigoism,â€™ itâ€™s near impossible to believe that up until 9 months ago, Ak and Dash had no set intention to be in the rap game at all.

I decided to put this project together because I have a lot of unreleased material that I didn't want to keep from the ears of my fans and supporters. I also have a couple of tracks on here I did when I was 15 years old (""little rachel"", ""indubitable"", and ""silent knight"") and I want to show people the progress I've made in a couple of years. The remaining songs (""flowers pt. I"", ""catharsis"", ""panty raid"", ""fantum"" and ""update"") are tracks I dropped prior to the release of '99 as promo only. I look at ""rejex"" as my more experimental side compared to '99. Putting together these two projects even taught me a lil sumchin about my evolution as an artist and individual.

The project gives the listener a peek at what itâ€™s like to be young and successful in the music business while still trying to find yourself and grow.  Mann describes it as â€œthat feeling after a night when you know youâ€™ve partied too hard and you say I need to stop all this but then go do it againâ€. 

 

Songs such as ""Bout That Life"", ""3's Company"" and ""4AM"" recount wild nights filled with weed, lean, women and his close friends the DANNON and BDMCG.  The project is filled with songs about living life to the fullest and having a great time.  â€œIâ€™m just trying to live everyday like itâ€™s my birthday because I know that at any moment it can all be goneâ€ says Mann.

TestMe, well known in the mid-Atlantic region, was featured with Young Jeezy, Lil Wayne, and Jim Jones on the Scream Tour and has had four previous radio singles.

This first single, entitled â€œParty Hardâ€, is a classic party anthem. The track and vocals guarantee that â€œParty Hardâ€ will dominate hip-hop airwaves through 2012. The futuristic epic feel, mixed with TestMeâ€™s lyrical flow, blend seamlessly to create a track, which is sure to keep the streets live and keep the clubs jumping.

BROWN CAESAR,Immortal Technique,sponsored,no,"The Martyr 
by Immortal Technique on Friday, July 8, 2011 at 12:21pm // Someone told me I was mean today. No I'm not mean. I'm just surrounded by Rebel Armz members who have a code of honor, by family who doesn't lie to me. And so, I developed a low tolerance for bullshit. I will cancel a woman who plays herself in half truths, I will strike down a man who stands in the way my goals and I will painstakingly devote my time to a cause others think is lost because I believe in it. 

Those of you close to me, you know. I am my father's son. And if that doesn't give you some idea of how much I don't fuck around then nothing will homie. I constantly try to give my time when I can but I get a million messages here I can't answer all of them, please don't harass my staff. I get lots of @ImmortalTech questions on twitter. I'm not specifically ignoring you when I don't respond. I value all causes and struggles, but the moment someone tells me that I'm not a real Revolutionary because I stop everything I'm doing and abandon the projects (both musical and human rights) to come work for you...you lose my respect. Grow up and act like a fuckin' man. This life we live is about sacrifices, about hard work and discipline. If anything being in my proximity you will notice why I get results, because I have no qualms about putting my heart and soul into something. Hip Hop is ONE of those things. While others desert her, and leave her to the culture vultures with reckless abandon, I will not. While some think the Palestinian cause lost, I do not. While others see the immigration fight as an impossible mountain to climb I do not. Some think because a few Black celebrities are paraded around in the media and we have Obama in office that this country isn't still a very racist place. But racism isn't the main problem, I've always said the feudal system never died, it just evolved into this modern caste system. A system that will feed on you until it's G checked. 

Just remember though activists, rappers, allies. I don't cut blank checks. And if you ask me I tell you the story of you and your people in way that will enlighten and hurt you, not purposefully, but I will give you the complete truth. The good and the bad. If you become angry at me for this, then you should be angry at yourself. You're the one who asked for the truth. I didn't create it. I just showed you where to look for it. If it didn't mix well with what you thought the world was blame mommy and daddy & your peers for sheltering you, lying to you or for not being there to educate you. I learn from my friends, from my Rebel Army soldiers, from my oldest friends like Cary, Ray, Vish, D. I learn from my family that which I give all I ever made too. 

So when it comes to music. I love my people and I will not leave them now in their darkest hour. Neither will my friends who are brave warriors and are willing to bleed for this. Rank and file we will out you from your comfortable spot and take the war to you, as you have taken it to our culture and our music for all these years. Our truce is done. Our peace is finished. Our war has begun.

IAmMixtapes,Pete Rock & Camp Lo,sponsored,no,"TSS is proud to present the official mixtape for the upcoming Pete Rock and Camp Loâ€™s summer album, 80 Blocks From Tiffanyâ€™s with Trackstar the DJ and DJ Mark Divita backing the project.

This tape does double duty. It reminds us of Camp Loâ€™s sometimes slept-on lyrical talent while serving hardcore fans with appetizers off the forthcoming full-length. Trackstarâ€™s blends of timeless beats from the Mecca and the Soul Brother days mesh perfectly with Camp Lo a cappellas unearthed from deep within the crates. Previously leaked singles of the full-length, â€œMic Checkâ€ and the freestyle â€œJimmy Page,â€ form the foundation of the tape and even if â€œMic Checkâ€ wonâ€™t make it onto your local radio, it still deserves a trip through your car speakers.

While weâ€™re always fans of new material, itâ€™s the hidden gems from Camp Loâ€™s earlier days that stand out. The Marvin Gaye sampled â€œSandman,â€ stands outâ€”a soulful reinterpretation exposition on Camp Loâ€™s love for women (plural). The focus on sampling and lyrical proficiency recalls a style fundamental to Hip-Hop, but in some ways passing us by.  As distant descendants of Native Tongues, both Sonny Cheeba and Geechi Suede fit comfortably with this genre, mixing classic sounds with their own brand of off-the-wall, multi-syllabic rhymes. Should be interesting to see what they can do over a full stable of Pete Rock joints.

While we await the full length project, this mixtape will serve as a reminder of things past and a preview of future dopeness.  Enjoy. (via thesmokingsection.uproxx.com)",yes,18499,Trackstar The DJ & Mark Divita,25063,149,5,3/31/2011,yes,80 Blocks From Tiffanys,21,108352

TheyCallMeTUNE,XV,sponsored,no,"Iâ€™ve been a fan of the producer James Yancey aka J Dilla, since I first purchased â€œLike Water For Chocolateâ€ by Common. I had became â€œXVâ€ the same year and I remember reading the credits and seeing that â€œJay Deeâ€ had produced almost ALL of the album. Back then, I used to download music out of chatrooms on AOL (LOL!) and I remember doing a search in on a mIRC server for Jay Dee and came across all of his earlier work with Slum Village as well as an instrumental version of â€œLike Water For Chocolateâ€. I studied the way he chopped samples (although I never could learn how he did what he did, especially because of me using Fruity Loops) and was amazed by his compression techniques. From that day on, I was a believer!


â€œDonutsâ€ was my first instrumental CD I copped from Dilla (I grabbed the earlier tapes later), and I started using them right away on my mixtapes. With those being earlier on in my career, I compiled a small collection of a few Dilla tracks Iâ€™ve done over the years, as well as a bonus with the producer, Nujabes (who shares Dillaâ€™s birthday as well) in there.

So, hereâ€™s a quick little tribute mixtape I callâ€¦ Thanks For The Donuts.
